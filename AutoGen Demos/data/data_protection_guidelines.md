# Data Protection Guidelines

## Principles
All business systems handling employee, customer, or partner data must align with the following principles:

- **Data Minimization**  
  Only collect data strictly required for legitimate business operations.

- **Encryption at Rest & In Transit**  
  Sensitive data must be encrypted using approved cryptographic standards.

- **Access Controls**
  Access should follow least-privilege principles validated through IAM and periodic access certification.

- **Regulatory Compliance**  
  Systems must support GDPR, local IT security mandates, industry frameworks, and internal audit requirements.

## Handling Personal Data
- Obtain explicit consent where jurisdictionally required.
- Use masking or anonymization during testing or training.
- Log access and changes to personal data.

## Incident Reporting
Suspected data breaches must be reported within 24 hours to the Corporate Security Incident Response Team.

## Review Cycle
All guidelines must undergo review every 12 months or whenever regulatory requirements change.
