# Claims Process Handbook

This handbook describes the internal claims evaluation workflow.

## Steps

1. Validate the customer documents.
2. Check policy eligibility and validity date.
3. Assess the claim type (accident, health, property).
4. Review risk flags if any (high-value claims must be escalated).
5. Approve or Reject with documented reasoning.

### SLA Policy

- Standard SLA for claim review: **15 working days**
- High-risk cases: **20 working days**

> Note: Audit logs must be retained for 5 years for compliance review.
